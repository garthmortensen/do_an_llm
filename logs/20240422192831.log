2024-04-22 19:28:37,897 - testing - INFO - Describe this year's severely adverse scenario, please sir.
This year's severely adverse scenario is a hypothetical set of conditions designed to assess the strength and resilience of banks in an adverse economic environment. It includes various economic variables such as measures of economic activity and prices, aggregate measures of asset prices or financial conditions, and interest rates. The scenario starts in the first quarter of 2024 and extends through the first quarter of 2027. It features 28 variables and includes international economic conditions in four countries or country blocs: the euro area, the United Kingdom, developing Asia, and Japan. The scenario also compares the current severely adverse scenario to the previous year's scenario, noting differences in variables like unemployment rates, interest rates, house prices, and international economic conditions.

2024-04-22 19:28:46,216 - testing - INFO - Create a yaml formatted list of the stress test scenarios and key variables and peaks for each
I don't have the ability to create files or formatted lists directly in this text-based interface. However, I can provide you with a YAML-formatted list that you can copy and paste into a YAML file or any text editor that supports YAML formatting. Here is an example of how you can structure the list:

```yaml
stress_test_scenarios:
  - scenario: Baseline Scenario
    key_variables:
      - real_GDP_growth: 1.9%
      - unemployment_rate: 4.1%
      - inflation_rate: 2.2%
      - treasury_rate: 3.1%
      - treasury_yield: 3.6%
      - prime_rate: [list of values]
      - equity_prices: [list of values]
      - equity_volatility: 28
      - house_prices_increase: 1.5%
      - commercial_real_estate_prices_increase: 1.5%
    peaks:
      - peak_date: Second quarter of 2025
        peak_values:
          - inflation_rate: 2.2%
          - treasury_rate: 3.1%
          - treasury_yield: 3.6%
  - scenario: Severely Adverse Scenario
    key_variables:
      - [list of key variables]
    peaks:
      - peak_date: [peak date]
        peak_values:
          - [list of peak values]
```

You can fill in the actual values for the key variables and peaks based on the information provided in the context. Let me know if you need further assistance!
